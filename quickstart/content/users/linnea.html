    <img src="/img/linnea.jpg" alt="picture of me">

    <p>My name is Linnea and I am 1/3 of team <b>Game of Code</b>. My goal in life is to 
    become a talanted coder whose good at solving problems. I have basic knowledge in some
    coding-languages, which you can find on the <b>About us</b> page if that interests you.
I started to learn my first language at 17 years old which was <b>html</b> and <b>css</b>, and from there
 I went on to learn the basics in a few more and to use diffrent tools. And I am looking
forward to expand my knowlede in the coding department to keep becoming better. <br>
<br>
Right now I am doing a one year education on coding, but I want to keep learning and will 
    go on to another coding-related education for at least 2 years after finishing my current education.
    Hopefully the future is bright and full of knowlede surrounding coding.
