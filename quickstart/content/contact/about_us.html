    <p>We are a small team constisting of 3 people who are getting educated in code. We 
            have been workning with <b>JAVA</b>, <b>C#</b>, <b>Html</b>, <b>Css</b>, <b>MySQL</b>
            , <b>Heroku</b>, <b>Netlify</b> and <b>Javascript.</b> Right now our team is exploring 
            the possibilities of GoHugo and that is the reason for this site. We are a positive 
            team constantly searching for more knowledge in the coding area to become better at
            what we do. Working together on projects makes us efficient and helps us solve problems
            with our combined knowledge. Because nothing gives us more joy than getting a problem solved
            bringing us one step closer to a finished project and the knowledge of solving diffrent 
            problems, making us more efficient in future projects where similar problems may occur.
