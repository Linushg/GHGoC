        There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. <b>I like to play games, I like to gym, I like to learn new things,
        I like to hanging out with my friends and I do also like to listen to music.</b> I started to learn and do some programming this year, 
        so I am still a beginner but I really like what I am doing and learning right now. I started this education because i want learn
        something new and i need a good fundamental before i move to the next level.
