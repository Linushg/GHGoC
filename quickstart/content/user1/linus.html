    <p>My name is Linus and I am 1/3 of team <b>Game of Code</b>. I have one goal in life and that is to always make the best of things. Since I love problemsolving and computers 
        I decided to go into codeing since I tought I would like it wich I did, a lot. I just stated codeing with a one month full time course in <b>Java</b> this summer before I started this 
        one year education. As for what I know right now I will have to refer you to the <a href="/contact/about_us">about us</a> page. My hope for the future is to be able to keep codeing 
        and makeing it my living while still finding it as fun as i do now. I have not decided if I want to study on but there is a good chance I will. As for what I do on my spare time I 
        mostly play computer games or I am teaching as an instructor for the first yearers in the swedish sea cadets called
        <a href="https://www.sjovarnskaren.se/ungdomsverksamhet/" target="_blank"><b>"Sjövärnskåren"</b></a>.
